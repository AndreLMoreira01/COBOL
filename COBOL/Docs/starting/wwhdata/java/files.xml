  The following CommonWordsToSkip block allows you to define what
  words will be omitted from the generated full text search index.
  We have provided a list of low information words that are common
  in English as a starting point.  However, if you are processing
  documents in a different language, you will need to adjust the
  words accordingly.

  The "minlen" attribute specifies the minimum length of word to
  include in the full text search index.  Words that are fewer
  characters in length than this value will automatically be
  omitted from the search database, and need not be explicitly
  listed inside this block.  The default value of 3 seems to work
  well for English.  A value of 1 may be needed for CJK languages
  where one character can represent a whole word or concept.

  The ScoringPrefs block allows you to control how search terms
  are scored by assigning different relative weights based on
  where a word occurs inside each document.  Three common
  META tags are supported by default, but this may be extended
  to custom META tags as follows (for a tag called partnum):

    <meta name="partnum" weight="100">

  For information on setting/creating META tags from within
  WebWorks Publisher, please see the online documentation.

  Note, that words occurring in elements not explicitly declared
  below will by default be scored with a weight of one.
