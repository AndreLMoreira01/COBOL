3.2  Project Management, Organization, and Structure
</h2>
<a name="wp1034351"> </a><p class="pBody">
In AcuBench, application development is organized into three levels of structure: workspace, project, and program.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034352"> </a><p class="pBody">
The central  unit is the <em class="cEmphasis">project</em>.  An AcuBench project includes all of the files and resources needed to build, test, and deploy an application.  Every project has its own compile, runtime, and environment settings (in fact, projects can have many sets of settings, called <em class="cEmphasis">modes</em>).  Every project is autonomous, although it can coexist and share resources with other projects.
</p>
<a name="wp1034353"> </a><p class="pBody">
To provide greater development flexibility, projects inhabit a larger working environment called the <em class="cEmphasis">workspace</em>.  The workspace hosts one or more projects and provides a common work area that supports the concurrent development of multiple projects.  The workspace also presents the project to you, in the Workspace window, in a format that makes it easy to access project components, options, and settings.
</p>
<a name="wp1034356"> </a><p class="pBody">
The workspace layer of AcuBench's architecture allows the concurrent development of multiple projects.  When projects belong to the same workspace, you can instantly switch between projects.  Each project's state information is preserved and each project's unique settings (compiler, runtime, and environment options) are maintained.  Projects can, but do not have to, share files.  Projects are not formally related in any way, other than belonging to the same workspace.
</p>
<a name="wp1034357"> </a><p class="pBody">
Every project has at least one <em class="cEmphasis">program</em> and can have many programs.  A program can consist of just the original COBOL source file, or it may be augmented to include a <em class="cEmphasis">program structure file</em>.  To use AcuBench's many graphical design tools and editors (excluding the Code Editor), your program must have a program structure file.  Such programs are displayed in and can be accessed from, the Workspace window's Structure tab.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034358"> </a><p class="pBody">
It is recommended that all AcuBench users read <a  href="wkb311.htm#wp1054900">section 3.5, &quot;Development Approaches.&quot;</a>  If you intend to use AcuBench's design tools and code generation facilities, it is also important that you read <a  href="wkb37.htm#wp1034395">section 3.3, &quot;Automated Code Generation.&quot;</a> 
</p>
<a name="wp1034359"> </a><p class="pBody">
The workspace, project, and program concepts are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
