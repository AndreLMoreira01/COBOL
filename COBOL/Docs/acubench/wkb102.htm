10.1 Screen Designer Windows
</h2>
<a name="wp1034344"> </a><p class="pBody">
The Screen Designer window is the primary window for designing a graphical or character-based application screen and is the basis of all screen designs.  This chapter describes the components of a Screen Designer window, the Property window, the Screen Component Toolbox, and other workbench functions that are directly related to the Screen Designer.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034346"> </a><p class="pBody">
By default, a Screen Designer window includes a standard title bar; Minimize, Maximize, and Close buttons; and a resizable border.  The title bar contains the project name, the program name, and the name of the screen file.  The screen form in which you design your screen appears inside the Screen Designer window.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034349"> </a><p class="pBody">
The Screen Designer allows you to create screens in both graphical and character-based environments.  Your application can contain both graphical and character-based screens, because the automatic code generation function creates code that labels the two types of screens differently in the Screen section.  You can copy a graphical screen to a character-based Screen Designer window.  Controls that are not supported in a character-based environment are simply not copied.  Some adjustment may be necessary after the copy operation, because graphical controls are measured differently from character controls.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034350"> </a><p class="pBody">
A screen form is a WYSIWYG grid window in which you develop a graphical or character-based application screen that becomes part of your application's user interface.  Like controls, a screen form has properties and events that can be set to match your design's needs.  The properties you specify for the screen form become the window properties in your COBOL program.  
</p>
<a name="wp1034352"> </a><p class="pBody">
You create a screen by adding controls and then setting properties and events for the controls.  When you arrange one or more controls on a screen form, and specify properties for each control, you are telling the Screen Designer how to generate the Screen section code for your data entry screen.  Note that when you create a graphical screen, you can set the screen form Property window item Unit to either &quot;Cells&quot; or &quot;Pixels&quot; depending on how you want control size and location measured. 
</p>
<a name="wp1034355"> </a><p class="pBody">
The Screen Designer's File/New/Screen command gives you access to default graphical and character-based screen templates.  A blank graphical or character screen template is just that: blank.  A standard graphical or character screen template includes a Menu Designer along with OK and Cancel push buttons.  The Menu Designer lets you set up a menu bar for your screen that contains all your application's menus and submenus. The password graphical or character screen includes Login Name and Password entry fields in addition to Login and Exit push buttons.  You can also add your own new or existing screen templates to the File/New/Screen dialog via the Tools/Options/Environment/Template interface.  More information about this dialog can be found in <a  href="wkb421.htm#wp1034529">section 4.4.2, &quot;Setting Template Options.&quot;</a>
