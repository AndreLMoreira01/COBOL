Sample Project for Windows NT/95/98
===================================

The sample project illustrates how the copybooks generated by the
Screen Painter can be copied into a program in development.  
In this sample project, the program "customer.cbl" contains the 
copybooks generated from the Screen Designer.
"Customer.cbl" opens a Customer File, called 
customer.dat, and can be used to browse/add/modify/delete records
in that file.

To start the sample project, use the Project Manager to Open 
samples.pjt, or double-click samples.pjt in the Windows explorer.

To run the sample program, "Customer", right-click on "customer.cbl"
in the Source tab, and select "Execute".

To view/modify the screen in the Screen Painter, click on the Structural
View of the Workspace, open "Samplprj", and, from within the "customer"
program, expand the Screen node, and double-click CUST-SCREEN.

Changes you make to the screen in the screen designer will be reflected
in the copy books

Customer.Wrk    Working-Storage Variables
Customer.Scr    Screen Section Code
Customer.Prd    Procedure Division Code
Customer.Evt    Event/Embedded Procedure Code

For a description of the files in the Sample Project see read_me.32
in the AcuGT directory or the click on the "Read Me" icon in the 
ACUCOBOL-GT folder.

CustSQL.cbl Information
=======================

The custsql.cbl program uses the same copy books and screen section as the
customer.cbl program described above.  The difference is that it uses
Embedded SQL to access data in a Access97 database via AcuSQL instead of 
COBOL I/O to access data in vision indexed files.

1) Setting up the ODBC DATASOURCE:
    i) Access the Control Panel through the Start Menu -> Settings
   ii) Double click on the ODBC Manager
  iii) Select the System DSN tab
   iv) Click on the Add button
    v) Select the MicroSoft Access ODBC Driver and click on finish
   vi) Enter "50_access" for the Data Source Name
  vii) Hit the select button and browse until you find the custsql.mdb
       Access97 database included in the sample\samplprj directory of
       you ACUCOBOL-GT distribution.   
 viii) Hit OK, Hit OK again.       

2) Enabling the Pre-compiler option in Workbench:
    i) Select Project Options from the Project menu of Acubench
   ii) On the Compiler Tab scroll down the catalogue combo box and
       select pre-compiler options
  iii) Select the Pre-compile Embedded SQL checkbox
   iv) Ensure that the Pre-compile and compile radio button is selected
    v) If you would like to view the results of the intermediate .asq file
       (post acusql pre-compiling, pre ACUCOBOL-GT compiling), select
       the -Po option.  Note that the default is to erase this file after
       a successful compile. Any problems encountered in the pre-compile/
       compile process are referenced back to the original source file.
       You should not modify this intermediate file as subsequent 
       pre-compile/compile operations will overwrite it.
