Java Interoperability Sample Instructions

prerequiste: ACUCOBOL-GT should already be installed.

1. Install JDK 1.4.2 or greater. A JDK is required because the compiler is required to build the samples.

2. Add CVM.jar and the current directory to the CLASSPATH environment variable. This CLASSPATH entry is used
for Java calling COBOL. This CVM.jar file is in the install bin directory. You will have an entry that looks
like this CLASSPATH=C:\Acucorp\Acucbl700\AcuGT\bin\CVM.jar;.;

3. There is a file called config that can be edited and used as a config file for running the samples.
For COBOL calling Java, the library (jvm.dll or libjvm.so) is specified by JAVA_LIBRARY_NAME. The entry would
look like JAVA_LIBRARY_NAME=jvm.dll on windows. A fully qualified path can be added with the name.
   
4. Add the options Config variable for interoperability (JAVA_OPTIONS, PRELOAD_JAVA_LIBRARY). For Java calling
COBOL, JAVA_OPTIONS should specify the same CLASSPATH as the environment like this:
JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djava.class.path=C:\Acucorp\Acucbl700\AcuGT\bin\CVM.jar;.;
The variable PRELOAD_JAVA_LIBRARY=1 tells the runtime to load the jvm upon initialization.

5. Add the location of jvm.dll/libjvm.so to the PATH environment variable. On windows, the entry
will look like: PATH=<additional path info>;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_03\jre\bin\client;
For convenience, it may be helpful to have the Java bin directory in the PATH as well. On windows, that 
directory might be C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_03\bin.

6. Add the location of the runtime dlls/shared libraries to the variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH so 
the entry will look like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=C:\Acucorp\Acucbl700\AcuGT\bin

7. Compile JavaCallingCobol.java (javac JavaCallingCobol.java)

8. Compile CobolCallingJava.java (javac CobolCallingJava.java)

9. Ensure that COPYPATH includes the acugt\sample\directory.  The program CobolCallingJava.cbl requires
   the copyfile java.def.
   
10. Compile JavaCallingCobol.cbl (ccbl/ccbl32 -x -Ga JavaCallingCobol.cbl)

11. Compile CobolCallingJava.cbl (ccbl/ccbl32 -x -Ga CobolCallingJava.cbl)

12. Run the Java calling Cobol test - java -Djava.library.path=<directory runcbl/wrun32 located> JavaCallingCobol cvm

13. Check the console log output to ensure it is correct

14. Run the Cobol calling Java test - runcbl/wrun32 CobolCallingJava

15. Check the log file CVM.log to ensure it is correct
