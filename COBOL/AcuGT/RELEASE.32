Release notes for ACUCOBOL-GT(R), Version 7.2.0
===============================================

This file contains documentation for features or changes
not found in the online or printed documentation.  For
information about new features at Version 7.2.0,
please see the online or printed Release Overview.


Web Runtime and Web Thin Client Display Problem
===============================================

Due to a problem in the underlying Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
libraries, under certain conditions the ACUCOBOL-GT Web Runtime and Web
Thin Client may exhibit an undesirable display behavior.  This behavior
occurs only when the COBOL application runs embedded in the browser
window (applications set to run in a separate window are unaffected).
If the COBOL application window is larger than the viewable area of the
browser's window, the browser automatically includes horizontal and/or
vertical scrollbars as needed.  When the user moves either of these
scrollbars, the COBOL application's display may noticeably flicker.
In severe instances, the COBOL application's display may become corrupt
(for example, appearing to be broken into numerous overlapping strips).

Acucorp is working with Microsoft to remedy the problem.  When a
correction is available, we will post the necessary updates to the
Support download area of the Acucorp website.

HP e3000
========

MPE files are now accessed using the ACUCOBOL-GT file system interface.
This was done to allow access to both Vision and KSAM indexed files in the
same COBOL program.  In previous versions to allow access to KSAM files you
needed to specify the following runtime configuration variable:

        DEFAULT_HOST KSAM

With this version you need to specify:

        DEFAULT_FILESYSTEM MPE

See section H.2 Configuration File Entries for more information related to
the DEFAULT_FILESYSTEM runtime configuration variable.

HP e3000 Printing
=================

The following statement:

   PRINTER1 -P /SYS/HPBIN/LP -d LP -s

in a configuration file or in a COBOL program will no longer work with the
new MPE file system interface in Version 7.0.0.  This was used as a
workaround because the runtime had not fully supported the HP COBOL method
for printing files.

You must now use the standard HP COBOL method for printing files either by
setting a file equation before running the program like:

  FILE PRINTER1;DEV=LP,1,1

or by specifying LP in the COBOL ASSIGN statement like:

  ASSIGN TO "PRINTER1,,,LP(NOCCTL)"
